# Theme Info

The "twentytwelve" theme was chosen for the following reasons:
* Professionally made
* Mobile friendly
* Aesthetically agnostic
* Foundational in testing new features

A third party theme could be chosen, but careful research should be conducted first.  From our experience, "free" themes don't play well from both technical and legal perspectives.  The wordpress themes such as "twentytwelve" are easily hackable.  It is **_HIGHLY_** recommended to alter the look and flow via [child theming](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes "Wordpress Child Themes").

The child theme that the site is currently using is the appropriately named "twentytwelve-child".
